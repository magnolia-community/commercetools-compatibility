# commercetools Connector module

The commercetools integration module `commercetools-integration` was deprecated in 2019, see [Deprecation List](https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/product-docs/6.2/Support/Deprecation-policy/Deprecations.html).
We have now donated it to our Forge community.

Please note that Magnolia does not maintain nor support this module any longer.
Support for commercetools, and other connectors, is available with our [Commerce Connector Pack](https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/product-docs/6.2/Connector-Packs/Commerce-Connector-Pack.html) from Magnolia version 6.2 and above.
